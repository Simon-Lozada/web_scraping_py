# web_scraping_py
This is a simple web scraping with python.

which contains two variants, one which uses the tor browser as a proxy server, in order to be as anonymous as possible.
And the other does not use tor, but has the advantage that it is faster.

Also, this project contains a script that Tor can use as a proxy (which you can use for other projects if you want). 
However, you have to do some basic settings in the Tor browser to use it.
